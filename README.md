# odin-rock-paper-scissors

This is my first JavaScript project for Odin. Currently, the goal is simply to create a rock paper scissors game where the player plays against the computer. 

For now everything is printed to the console, but there are plans to revisit it, so it shouldn't stay in the console forever. But until then, read the instructions below to access the console if you don't already know how to access it. 

You may already know how to access the console, but just in case you can get to it by pressing ctrl+shift+c or ctrl+shift+i (mac users use cmd instead of ctrl). You can just right click in the browser window and choose "inspect" from the menu that pops up. Once the console window is open, click on "Console" tab and then you'll be able to see the results of the game!
